## :rocket: About the project

<p>
  This is the repository (backend and frontend) to an app for registry occurrences in some city, village, or other. 
  <br />
  For example, if you go on the street and see an hole, you can take a foto, describe the situation and send it to the competent authorities. They will address the issue and you will receive an email.
</p>
<p>This project contains both, backend in NodeJS and Frontend with Angular8.</p>
